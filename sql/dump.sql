She grew up in San Diego, California. She started her professional career as a model in 1980 at age 14, and worked both in Paris and Japan. After finishing high school she decided to become an actress. She got a role on the soap opera Santa Barbara (1984), for which she was nominated three times for a Daytime Emmy. During the first season of the show, she fell in love with fellow cast member Dane Witherspoon, whom she married in 1986. Meanwhile, she starred in Princes? ir nuotaka (1987), playing the title role.

In 1990, she was in Nuolankumo busena (1990), where she met actor Sean Penn, by whom she had a daughter, Dylan Frances, and a son, Hopper Jack. After taking some time off, Robin was back to Hollywood with one the best roles of her career: She played Tara in The Playboys (1992). She was extremely stunning and brilliant. Then, she acted in ?aislai (1992) with Robin Williams, and she gave a funny performance. In 1994, Wright was in the blockbuster hit Forestas Gampas (1994), with Tom Hanks. For her performance as Jenny, she got a nomination for a Golden Globe Award. She got a small role in Eismo reguliuotojas (1995), which starred Jack Nicholson.

His mother, Julia (Moccello), was a homemaker. His father, Daniel, Sr., was a small business owner whose ventures included a dry cleaning shop, a dairy outlet, a diner, and a pool hall.'),(13,'Matthew Broderick','A slight comic actor chiefly known for his boyish charm, Matthew Broderick was born on March 21, 1962 in New York City, to Patricia Broderick (n?e Biow), a playwright and painter, and James Broderick, an actor. His father had Irish and English ancestry, and his mother was from a Jewish family (from Germany and Poland).Matthew initially took up acting at New York\'s upper-crust Walden School after being sidelined from his athletic pursuits (football and soccer) by a knee injury. His father got him his stage debut at age 17 in a workshop production of the play \'On Valentine\'s Day\'. Matthew\'s career then accelerated with parts in two Neil Simon projects: the play \'Brighton Beach Memoirs\' (1982-83) and the feature film Max Dugan Returns (1983). Broderick reprised the role of Eugene in \'Biloxi Blues\' (1988), the second installment of the Simon trilogy, for both the Broadway production and the film adaptation (Biloksio bliuzas (1988)). For the third and final installment of the trilogy, he was replaced by Jonathan Silverman. In 1983, the same year as Max Dugan Returns (1983), Broderick had his first big-screen success in the light comedy Karo ?aidimai (1983). Since then he has had his fair share of hits and misses, with some of his better films including Project X (1987) also starring Helen Hunt, whom he subsequently dated; Addicted to Love (1997); and Inspektorius Gadzetas (1999). Other films he has appeared in which may be known but not so much respected include Out on a Limb (1992) with his Ferio Biulerio poilsio diena (1986) co-star Jeffrey Jones; The Night We Never Met (1993); Kelias ? Velvil? (1994); and Prielipa (1996) with Jim Carrey, which got him an MTV \'Best Fight\' award nomination; and the MTV film I?si?okele (1999) with Reese Witherspoon. In 1985 he was involved in a controversial car crash while driving in Ireland with his then fianc?e Jennifer Grey. The crash killed a woman and her daughter. Broderick paid a small fine to the family of the victims. He broke his leg in the accident, which happened just as Ferio Biulerio poilsio diena (1986), his biggest hit, was coming out in the US. The box office success (but critical flop) and special effects blockbuster Godzila (1998) gave Broderick his first action role (should any \'Godzilla\' sequels be planned, he is under contract for two more). He has occasionally returned to the stage in New York, either in revivals of old musical warhorses such as \'How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying\' or in revivals of old \'show people\'plays, such as \'Night Must Fall\'. In 1996 Broderick attempted to wear three hats as co-producer/director/actor in Infinity (1996), working very closely with his mother, who also wrote the screenplay. It was not a critical or commercial success, and he has not directed or produced since. Since May 1997 he has been married to actress Sarah Jessica Parker. He was previously engaged to both Helen Hunt and dated Lili Taylor. In 1999 he donned a trenchcoat for the children\'s film Inspektorius Gadzetas (1999), alongside Rupert Everett as the evil villain Claw. In March 2001 Broderick returned to Broadway in the musical smash \'The Producers\' (based on the 1968 Mel Brooks film of the same name). He was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical, which he lost to his co-star, Nathan Lane.'),(14,'Bruce Willis','Actor and musician Bruce Willis is well known for playing wisecracking or hard-edged characters, often in spectacular action films. Collectively, he has appeared in films that have grossed in excess of $2.5 billion USD, placing him in the top ten stars in terms of box office receipts. Walter Bruce Willis was born on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, West Germany, to a German mother, Marlene Kassel, and an American father, David Andrew Willis (from Carneys Point, New Jersey), who were then living on a United States military base. His family moved to the U.S. shortly after he was born, and he was raised in Penns Grove, New Jersey, where his mother worked at a bank and his father was a welder and factory worker. Willis picked up an interest for the dramatic arts in high school, and was allegedly \'discovered\' whilst working in a caf? in New York City and then appeared in a couple of off-Broadway productions. While bartending one night, he was seen by a casting director who liked his personality and needed a bartender for a small movie role. After countless auditions, Willis contributed minor film appearances, usually uncredited, before landing the role of private eye \'David Addison\' alongside sultry Cybill Shepherd in the hit romantic comedy television series Moonlighting (1985). His sarcastic and wisecracking P.I. is seen by some as a dry run for the role of hard-boiled NYC detective \'John McClane\' in the monster hit Kietas rie?ut?lis (1988), in which Willis\' character single-handedly battled a gang of ruthless international thieves in a Los Angeles skyscraper. He reprised the role of McClane in the sequel, Kietas rie?utelis 2 (1990), set at a snowbound Washington\'s Dulles International Airport as a group of renegade Special Forces soldiers seek to repatriate a corrupt South American general. Excellent box office returns demanded a further sequel Kietas rie?utelis. Ker?tas su kaupu (1995), this time co-starring Samuel L. Jackson as a cynical Harlem shop owner unwittingly thrust into assisting McClane during a terrorist bombing campaign on a sweltering day in New York. Willis found time out from all the action mayhem to provide the voice of \'Mikey\' the baby in the very popular family comedies Kas ?ia kalba? (1989), and its sequel ?iurekit, kas vel kalba (1990) also starring John Travolta and Kirstie Alley. Over the next decade, Willis starred in some very successful films, some very offbeat films and some unfortunate box office flops. Tu?tybiu liepsna (1990) and Hadsono vanagas (1991) were both large scale financial disasters that were savaged by the critics, and both are arguably best left off the CVs of all the actors involved, however Willis was still popular with movie audiences and selling plenty of theatre tickets with the hyper-violent Paskutinis skautas (1991), the darkly humored Mirtis jai tinka (1992) and the mediocre police thriller Per plauk? nuo pra?uties (1993). During the 1990s, Willis also appeared in several independent and low budget productions that won him new fans and praise from the critics for his intriguing performances working with some very diverse film directors. He appeared in the oddly appealing Nortas (1994), as a cagey prizefighter in the Quentin Tarantino directed mega-hit Bulvarinis skaitalas (1994), the Terry Gilliam directed apocalyptic thriller Dvylika be?d?ioni? (1995), the Luc Besson directed sci-fi opus Penktasis elementas (1997) and the M. Night Shyamalan directed spine-tingling epic ?e?tasis poj?tis (1999). Willis next starred in the gangster comedy Devyni jardai (2000), worked again with \'hot\' director M. Night Shyamalan in the less than gripping Nepalau?iamasis (2000), and in two military dramas, Harto karas (2002) and Saules a?aros (2003) that both failed to really fire with movie audiences or critics alike. However, Willis bounced back into the spotlight in the critically applauded Frank Miller graphic novel turned movie Nuod?mi? miestas (2005), the voice of \'RJ\' the scheming raccoon in the animated hit Anapus tvoros (2006) and \'Die Hard\' fans rejoiced to see \'John McClane\' return to the big screen in the high tech Kietas rie?utelis 4.0 (2007) aka \'Die Hard 4.0\'.'),(15,'Jason Momoa','Joseph Jason Namakaeha Momoa was born on August 1, 1979, in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is the son of Coni (Lemke), a photographer, and Joseph Momoa, a painter. His father is of Native Hawaiian and Samoan descent; and his mother, who is from Iowa, is of German, Irish, and Native American ancestry. Jason was raised in Norwalk, Iowa, by his mother. After high school, he moved to Hawaii, where he landed a lead role, beating out of thousands of hopefuls in the TV series Gelbetojai (1989) (known as \'Baywatch Hawaii\' in its 10th season). When the show ended, he spent the next couple of years traveling around the world. In 2001, he moved to Los Angeles, where he continued to pursue an acting career. In 2004, after the short-lived TV series North Shore (2004), he was cast as the popular character \'Ronon Dex\' in the TV series ?vaig?d?i? vartai: Atlantida (2004), which achieved a cult-like following. In 2010, he appeared in the Emmy-nominated HBO series Sost? karai (2011), playing the Dothraki king, Khal Drogo. To illustrate to the producers that he was Khal Drogo, he performed the Haka, a traditional war dance of the Maori of New Zealand. The audition was with the same casting director who was casting the titular role in the reboot of Konanas barbaras (2011). Four weeks after being cast as the popular Robert E. Howard character, Momoa began shooting in Bulgaria. His approach, like that of the filmmakers, was to pull from the eight decades of comics and stories as well as the Frank Frazetta images rather than the hugely popular 1982 movie. Jason has a production company, Pride of Gypsies, in which he is expanding his career from actor to filmmaker. He has directed a couple of short films and is working on his feature film debut Road to Paloma (2014), which is pulled from a series of stories that he\'s been developing over the years, which he calls the Brown Bag Diaries: Ridin\' the Blinds in B Minor (2010). Jason lives with his wife, actress Lisa Bonet, with whom he has two children, Lola and Nakoa-Wolf.'),(16,'Jack Whitehall','Jack Whitehall was a child actor in various television dramas, but decided to pursue stand-up comedy after leaving school. He was a finalist in the So You Think You\'re Funny talent hunt at last year\'s Edinburgh Fringe, and was nominated for best newcomer at this year\'s Chortle Awards. In December 2012 he was awarded the title King of Comedy by the British Comedy Awards, perhaps his most prestigious award yet.'),(17,'Darby Camp','Darby Camp began acting as a toddler alongside her mother and older sister. Together they were seen in local commercials and print ads in their hometown of Charlotte, NC. By the time Darby was eight years old it was evident her gift for acting was best served in film and television. She spent two seasons as the sassy Chloe McKenzie in the Emmy-winning HBO series, Big Little Lies (2017). You can watch her now on Netflix alongside Kurt Russell in Kal?d? kronikos (2018) and The Christmas Chronicles: Part Two (2020). Her latest project is Paramount\'s Di?kis ?uo Klifordas (2021) where she stars as Emily Elizabeth. When Darby isn\'t acting, she\'s most likely enjoying the slow pace of southern living with her family, friends and beloved pets.'),(18,'Sienna Guillory','Sienna Guillory is the daughter of American folk guitarist Isaac Guillory and Tina Thompson, an English model. Guillory\'s parents encouraged her to express herself artistically as she was growing up and this led to her decision to become an actor. She was educated at Gresham\'s School, Holt, Norfolk, England and appeared in school plays. Her acting break came when she was 16, and was cast in the TV movie Riders (1993). To support her acting career, Guillory also took up modeling and appeared in campaigns for such high profile companies as Armani and Dolce & Gabbana, as well as gracing many magazine covers. Further acting success followed in TV and films. Projects include Laiko ma?ina (2002), Tegyvuoja meil? (2003) and the \'Resident Evil\' film series.'),(19,'Keanu Reeves','Keanu Charles Reeves, whose first name means \'cool breeze over the mountains\' in Hawaiian, was born September 2, 1964 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is the son of Patricia Taylor, a showgirl and costume designer, and Samuel Nowlin Reeves, a geologist. Keanu\'s father was born in Hawaii, of British, Portuguese, Native Hawaiian, and Chinese ancestry, and Keanu\'s mother is originally from England. After his parents\' marriage dissolved, Keanu moved with his mother and younger sister, Kim Reeves, to New York City, then Toronto. Stepfather #1 was Paul Aaron, a stage and film director - he and Patricia divorced within a year, after which she went on to marry (and divorce) rock promoter Robert Miller and hair salon owner Jack Bond. Reeves never reconnected with his biological father. In high school, Reeves was lukewarm toward academics but took a keen interest in ice hockey (as team goalie, he earned the nickname \'The Wall\') and drama. He eventually dropped out of school to pursue an acting career. After a few stage gigs and a handful of made-for-TV movies, he scored a supporting role in the Rob Lowe hockey flick Youngblood (1986), which was filmed in Canada. Shortly after the production wrapped, Reeves packed his bags and headed for Hollywood. Reeves popped up on critics\' radar with his performance in the dark adolescent drama, River\'s Edge (1986), and landed a supporting role in the Oscar-nominated Pavojingi ry?iai (1988) with director Stephen Frears. His first popular success was the role of totally rad dude Ted \'Theodore\' Logan in Bill & Ted\'s Excellent Adventure (1989). The wacky time-travel movie became something of a cultural phenomenon, and audiences would forever confuse Reeves\'s real-life persona with that of his doofy on-screen counterpart. He then joined the casts of Ron Howard\'s comedy, Ak, jau tie tevai (1989) and Lawrence Kasdan\'s Tik mirtis mus i?skirs (1990). Over the next few years, Reeves tried to shake the Ted stigma with a series of highbrow projects. He played a slumming rich boy opposite River Phoenix\'s narcoleptic male hustler in Manasis Aidahas (1991), an unlucky lawyer who stumbles into the vampire\'s lair in Bremo Stokerio Drakula (1992), and Shakespearean party-pooper Don John in Daug triuk?mo del nieko (1993). In 1994, the understated actor became a big-budget action star with the release of Greitis (1994). Its success heralded an era of five years in which Reeves would alternate between small films, like Jausmingoji Minesota (1996) and The Last Time I Committed Suicide (1997), and big films like Pasivaik??iojimas debesyse (1995) and Velnio advokatas (1997). (There were a couple misfires, too: D?onis Mnemonikas (1995) and Grandinin? reakcija (1996).) After all this, Reeves did the unthinkable and passed on the Speed sequel, but he struck box-office gold again a few years later with the Wachowski siblings\' cyberadventure, Matrica (1999). Now a bonafide box-office star, Keanu would appear in a string of smaller films -- among them Atsarginiai (2000), Stebetojas (2000), Dievo dovana (2000), Saldus lapkritis (2001), and Tikras zaidimas (2001) - before Matrica: Perkrauta (2003) and Matrica. Revoliucijos (2003) were both released in 2003. Since the end of The Matrix trilogy, Keanu has divided his time between mainstream and indie fare, landing hits with Myleti(s) smagu (2003), Namas prie ezero (2006), and Nakties klajunai (2008). He\'s kept Matrix fans satiated with films such as Konstantinas (2005), Nei?velgiamas pasaulis (2006), and Diena, kai sustojo ?eme (2008). And he\'s waded back into art-house territory with Ele Parker (2005), ?iulpiantis nyk?t? (2005), Asmeniniai Pipos Li gyvenimai (2009), and Henrio nusikaltimas (2010). Most recently, as post-production on the samurai epic 47 Roninai (2013) waged on, Keanu appeared in front of the camera in Side by Side (2012), a documentary on celluloid and digital filmmaking, which he also produced. He also directed another Asian-influenced project, Tai Ci Meistras (2013). In 2014, Keanu played the title role in the action revenge film D?onas Vikas (2014), which became popular with critics and audiences alike. He reprised the role in D?onas Vikas 2 (2017), taking the now-iconic character to a better opening weekend and even more enthusiastic reviews than the first go-around.'),(20,'Carrie-Anne Moss','Carrie-Anne Moss was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada. At age 20, after studying at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, she moved to Europe to pursue a career in modeling. While in Spain she was cast in the TV show Dark Justice which was produced in Barcelona for its first season and Los Angeles for its second. Once in LA, Carrie-Anne was cast in other series regular opportunities like Matrix (which coincidentally presaged the movie that would later make her famous), and then Aaron Spelling\'s Models Inc. Carrie-Anne\'s work was gaining attention when the late great Mali Finn brought her in to audition for The Wachowski\'s, who offered her the opportunity to create the iconic cyber warrior \'Trinity\'. Alongside her \'One\' Keanu Reeves, in stride with Laurence Fishburne and the multifaceted Hugo Weaving. Carrie-Anne Moss galvanized her place in cinematic history in one of the highest grossing sci-fi action franchises of all time.'),(21,'Jonathan Groff','Don\'t let the world define you. In the world of acting, and I think in any profession really, people are really eager to put you in a box and categorize you as one particular thing. Make sure that you always follow your heart and your gut, and let yourself be who you want to be, and who you know you are. And don\'t let anyone steal your joy.'),(22,'Toby Stephens','Toby Stephens began his acting career while a stagehand at the Chichester Festival Theatre, in end-of-season productions mounted by the crew. In his brief professional career, he has already won the Sir John Gielgud Prize for Best Actor and the Ian Charleson Award for his performance in the title role of \'Coriolanus\' at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1994. His other work at the RSC includes \'Measure for Measure\', \'A Midsummer Night\'s Dream\', \'Antony and Cleopatra\', \'Wallenstein\', \'All\'s Well That Ends Well\' and \'Unfinished Business\'. Stephens also starred in Peter Hall\'s production of \'Tartuffe\' at the Aldwych Theatre and has just finished filming The Tenant of Wildfell Hall (1996). His television appearances include A View from the Bridge (2012) and The Camomile Lawn (1992).

Arrived on Earth, representatives of the most ancient race, referred to as the Eternals, they perform a difficult mission. Their task is to protect earthlings from the monstrous creatures of the Deviants. The latter are the most dangerous creatures from galactic space, who have been opposed by alien warriors for years. Today they have a different task - to control and monitor people\'s lives without interfering in the development process. Well, maybe just a little, stimulating the techno boom. Actions acquire dynamics in the present time, on the verge of the inevitable. The earth must wake up. And this threatens with irreversible consequences - destruction. The main characters in an accelerated mode need to prevent the death of the planet they are in love with, the people they are attached to.',185),(2,'The Cloverfield Paradox','The population of the planet is once again exposed to serious danger. The impractical consumption of natural resources is about to lead to their natural depletion, which will entail the inevitable death of life on Earth. In order to prevent an energy collapse, a group of brave astronauts is sent to the bowels of the galactic space for experimental experiments. In order to achieve an alternative supply of mankind with the sources of necessary energy, scientists are conducting a number of studies. And, while there are debates on the planet between the leaders of states, while civilization is on the verge of extinction, researchers are trying to do the impossible. At the Cloverfield orbital station, they are tasked with troubleshooting the rotation of the particle accelerator, which will be the key to the operation of the infinite energy derivative. Several attempts to start the device do not bring results, which causes tension in the team. When the unit begins to gain power, a monstrous, irreparable mistake occurs.',96),(3,'The Titan','When the scale of depleted natural resources exceeds all acceptable limits, a secret government organization offers an alternative solution to the inevitable disappearance of civilization.

Researchers are ready to bring nanotechnology to the masses...when the side effects start showing up.',65),(4,'The Congress','The future of the world is hazy and blurry. This is due to the rapid development of innovative technologies. For this reason, the boundaries of real and virtual reality are blurred. There are fears that soon no one will be able to distinguish reality from fiction. Robin Wright has been a sought-after actress in the past. But all the best roles that she could have played on stage have already been played. Now she has to be content with little, not sorting out with offers. When a major film studio offers to scan her image to use later without her permission in any filming, Robin does not have to interfere and she agrees. Her son Aaron needs medical attention, so the actress does not think for a long time. Since then, more than a dozen years have passed. Robin arrives by invitation to a convention held in a fictional world. Now the future is in her hands - to stay in the past, where there are no jobs, no prospects, but there is a son who needs help. Or choose a bright future, where she is destined for the role of a screen star.',45),(5,'Deck the Halls','Steve Finch is used to an orderly lifestyle. As befits a perfectionist, Steve honors perfection in every detail. And he sees the approach of Christmas through the prism of his own pedantic gaze. He makes his family wear warm sweaters with a Christmas theme. Then he takes out an advent calendar, the days of which are painted with plans for holiday chores. In his understanding, all these attributes and symbols will instill the spirit of Christmas into the house, which will unite all family members in a special way. When new neighbors move into the house opposite, Steve is the first to rush to introduce himself as a respectable person. The newcomers are not a typical family. Buddy Hall is a loser in life. The only thing that warms the soul is a beautiful wife and two wonderful daughters. When the girls show their father a view of the area from space, Buddy is horrified to notice that their mansion is not visible. In an attempt to mark a point on the map, Buddy buys up all the holiday lights so that the lights of the garlands will become a wire beacon to the universe.',115),(6,'Once Upon a Time in Venice','The protagonist gave many years of service in the police.

In the midst of the annual carnival, Emily receives an unusual red puppy as a gift from animal rescuer Mr. Bridwell. He warns the girl that the dog will grow depending on how much he gets.

While mom is working away from home, Emily and a new friend named Clifford have unforgettable adventures ahead.',75),(8,'The Matrix Resurrections','The destroyed world becomes the dramatic finale of the long-term confrontation between people and machines. In the name of preserving sweet freedom and anticipation of triumph, people took desperate, radical steps, trying to disconnect artificial intelligence from the supply. However, extreme measures did not bring the desired result, breaking all dreams and aspirations into fragments of unfulfilled hopes. Machines have found a way that allows them to exist without artificial energy, drawing it from the human body. For the sake of this, entire farms were created, where the production of people based on a set of DNA was established. The next step of the machines was the organization of total control over people, the result of which was the creation of a matrix. However, a person who realized the whole truth of the virtual world volunteered to confront the world of technology. Neo has created resistance in the name of saving civilization, where a person rules, not a soulless mechanism. He was ready to sacrifice himself. But perhaps Neo\'s death was only the beginning of the confrontation?!',165),(9,'The Machine','The unstable situation in the world is forcing the British Ministry of Defense to seek help from professor, scientist Vincent McCarthy. An impeccable reputation, coupled with brilliant data, does not allow the leaders of the ministry to doubt the ways to solve the problem that McCarthy will offer. After a little thought, the professor finds a way out of the current situation - to create a soulless android machine. Its artificial intelligence will create an excellent platform for further development with the subsequent replacement of robots with people on the battlefield. The professor\'s proposal impresses the leadership of the kingdom - fabulous money is allocated for the creation of a trial sample. However, after creating the machine, a technical failure occurs - a minor software error causes the android to destroy the entire laboratory. The consequences of the failure radically change Vincent\'s original ideas. Now he\'s asking an AI expert to help him use the machine\'s full potential.',66);
